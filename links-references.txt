Missed last Thursdays class due to illness
got Katherines files on Tuesday also the day I found out there was homework.
Had to finish Authoring Homework first, ran out of time, was also confused. Missing that class really buggered me.
Was going to try to make it to another class, but our class is the later one iin the week.
Sorry for the shoddy work
